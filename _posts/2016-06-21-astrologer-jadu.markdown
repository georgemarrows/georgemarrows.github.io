One of the first posters I noticed in Nairobi. Of course, you can also find any number of [psychics in New York](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatlife/12186245/Emma-Freud-Can-the-psychics-of-New-York-predict-what-will-happen-to-my-family-next.html). Kenya's not alone in this nuttiness. (Trigger warning: link is to the Telegraph.)
